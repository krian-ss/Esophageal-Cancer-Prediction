# Esophageal Cancer Detection Using Tensorflow and EfficientNetB7
This project implements a deep learning model for binary classification of esophageal cancer using endoscopy images. It utilizes transfer learning with EfficientNetB7 as the base model, built on TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on a dataset of endoscopy images, categorized into 'esophagus' and 'no-esophagus' classes.

The code handles data preparation, model creation, training, and result visualization, providing a complete pipeline for esophageal cancer detection from medical imaging data.

# Features Include
> Transfer learning with EfficientNetB7
> Data augmentation using ImageDataGenerator
> Binary classification (cancer/no cancer)
> Visualization of training and validation metrics
> Model saving for future use
> Prediction of cancer

# Tech Stack Used
